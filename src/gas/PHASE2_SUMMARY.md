# Makkaizou-LINE Integration: Phase 2 Summary

## Phase 2: Core Functionality

In Phase 2, we've implemented the core functionality of the Makkaizou-LINE integration, enabling the bot to process messages, interact with the Makkaizou API, and respond to users in LINE conversations.

### Implemented Features

#### 1. Enhanced Mention Detection

- Improved the `isBotMentioned` function to detect mentions in two ways:
  - Text-based mentions using the `@botName` format
  - Native LINE API mentions using the `mention` property
- Added configuration for the bot's LINE user ID to support native mentions

#### 2. Talk ID Management

- Implemented the `TalkIdManager.js` module to handle mapping between LINE users/groups and Makkaizou talk IDs
- Functions for creating, retrieving, and managing talk IDs
- Persistent storage of mappings in the spreadsheet

#### 3. Makkaizou API Integration

- Created the `MakkaizouApi.js` module for interacting with the Makkaizou AI platform
- Implemented functions for sending messages to Makkaizou and processing responses
- Added error handling and logging for API interactions
- Included status checking functionality

#### 4. Response Formatting

- Implemented smart message splitting for long responses (LINE has a 5000 character limit)
- Split messages at natural breaking points (end of sentences or paragraphs)
- Support for handling different response types

### Configuration Requirements

The following configuration values should be set in the Configuration sheet:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `makkaizou_api_key` | API key for the Makkaizou platform |
| `line_access_token` | Access token for the LINE Messaging API |
| `line_channel_secret` | Channel secret for validating LINE webhooks |
| `bot_name` | The name of the bot for text-based mention detection |
| `line_bot_user_id` | The LINE user ID of the bot for native mention detection |
| `enable_loading_indicator` | Whether to show loading indicators (true/false) |
| `debug_mode` | Whether to enable debug logging (true/false) |

### Testing

To test the integration:

1. Deploy the latest version of the script as a web app
2. Configure the LINE webhook URL to point to the deployed web app
3. Add the bot to a LINE group or send a direct message
4. Mention the bot using `@botName` followed by your message
5. The bot should respond with a message from the Makkaizou AI

### Next Steps (Phase 3)

- Implement advanced message formatting with Flex messages
- Add support for image and other media types
- Implement user and group management features
- Add conversation context management
- Implement rate limiting and quota management
