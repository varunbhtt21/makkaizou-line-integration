# Phase 1 Summary: Foundation

## Completed Tasks

In Phase 1, we have successfully set up the foundation for the Makkaizou-LINE integration:

### 1. Google Sheets Structure

- Defined the structure for the following sheets:
  - **Mapping**: For storing user/group to talk_id mappings
  - **Configuration**: For storing API keys and settings
  - **Logs**: For recording message interactions
  - **ErrorLogs**: For detailed error logging
- Created utility functions to interact with these sheets

### 2. GAS Project Setup

- Created the main script file (`Code.js`) with:
  - Webhook handling (`doPost` function)
  - Event processing logic
  - Configuration management
  - Logging functionality
- Created utility files:
  - `TalkIdManager.js` for managing talk_ids
  - `LineApi.js` for interacting with the LINE API

### 3. Webhook Validation

- Implemented signature validation for LINE webhooks
- Added error handling for validation failures
- Created a flexible validation system that works in both development and production

### 4. Basic Logging

- Implemented comprehensive logging system with different levels:
  - Info logging for normal operations
  - Debug logging for development
  - Warning logging for potential issues
  - Error logging for failures
- Created structured log storage in Google Sheets

### 5. Documentation

- Created detailed documentation:
  - README.md with project overview
  - DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with step-by-step setup instructions
  - sheets_structure.md with details on the Google Sheets structure

## Next Steps: Phase 2

In Phase 2, we will implement the core functionality of the integration:

### 1. Enhanced Mention Detection

- Improve the mention detection to use the LINE API's mention property
- Handle different types of mentions (user, all)
- Support for different mention formats

### 2. Makkaizou API Integration

- Create a new utility file for Makkaizou API interactions
- Implement functions to send messages to Makkaizou
- Handle Makkaizou API responses and errors

### 3. Message Processing

- Extract and clean message content
- Forward messages to Makkaizou with appropriate talk_id
- Process and format Makkaizou responses

### 4. Response Handling

- Implement response formatting
- Support for references in responses
- Add loading indicators during processing

### 5. Testing

- Test the full message flow
- Verify talk_id management
- Ensure proper error handling

## Getting Started with Phase 2

To begin Phase 2 implementation:

1. Complete the Phase 1 setup as described in the DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
2. Verify that the webhook is receiving messages from LINE
3. Check that the logging system is working correctly
4. Ensure that the configuration is properly set up

Once these prerequisites are met, we can proceed with implementing the Makkaizou API integration and enhancing the message processing capabilities.
